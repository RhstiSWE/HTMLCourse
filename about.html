      Ato Ateweberhan Segid, Osman Abdurahim and Alamin Abdeletif are just three
      of the many great singers of all time, of Eritrean. Along with many
      others, these stars were joined together through the common cause of
      unifying Eritrea (during the time of the War for Indepedence) in the
      (Asmara Theater Association) also famously known as "MaTA" . Here, many
      singers pushed for a cultural unification amongst Eritrean, as well as
      using music to boost the morale of the prople during this long period of
      hardship.

      This Organization of talented Musicians also did a great job including
      female in this push for Eritrean national identity through music,
      including the famous Teberh Tesfahuney.

      Alemeyahu Kasahai is described as the Father of Modern theatre in
      Eritreafor Eritreans. Before the 1940's all play were catered to the
      Occupying Italians, not the native Eritreans. Kasahai went on to create
      Mahber Theatre (Indigenous Theater) in the mid 1940's and began teaching
      Shakespeare and putting on plays for the native Eritreans for the first
      time, while under British control. The plays started with mixed messages
      and both slapstick humor/serious discussions.

      Women were introduced into theatre more reluctantly than in the music
      world. MATA (Asmara Theater Association) was created in 1961 until its end
      in 1974. With Haile Selassie attempting to keep Eritrea under close watch,
      he made sure all of the scripts were read by Ethiopian's to make sure
      there were no hidden political agendas. This did not stop the Eritrean's
      from pushing coded messages in support of Liberation and a free nation of
      Eritrea. When the Derg took over. their ruthless war tactics terrorized
      (then called) Cinema Asmara, at one point they stormed a play of 2,000
      people and one playwright was said to have been shot 24 times and left for
      dead by Ethiopian soldiers as the Derg did not approve of what was going
      on in the Theater in terms of catering to the Eritrean people.

      The stories of/history of Mahber Theatre/Asmara Theater/Cinema Asmara
      peresent the visual and lyrical/audible artistic talent of the Eritrean
      people from before and during the time of war. As well as the
      determination by the Eritrean people to create an environment that would
      promote national pride, strength and willpower all things that drove and
      boosted the morale of soldiers and civilians in their fight for Freedom.
